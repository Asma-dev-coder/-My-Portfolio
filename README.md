# -My-Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to showcase my web development skills, projects, and technical expertise in a clean and professional layout.  The website includes sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, Contact Form, and a responsive navigation bar.
